This program is made for the minecraft server MCUltinium. 

Minecraft tends to update a lot and this is a perfect way for people to downgrade to the version that the server is running!

To downgrade just press the downgrade button. Once you are done with that, open up the mineshafter or magic launcher to run the game. Premium minecraft users are suggested to use magic launcher.
